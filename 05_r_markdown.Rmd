# R Markdown

In this workshop we will see how to generate a report in .html format using R Markdown. Reports written using R Markdown allow you to combine narrative that you’ve written along with R code chunks, and the output associated with those code chunks all in one knitted document. The assignments for this unit need to be produced using R Markdown.


## Overview

In the following video I will give you a brief overview of how you can turn a script you have written in R into an R Markdown document that you can 'knit' and share with others.
