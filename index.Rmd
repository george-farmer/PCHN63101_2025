Welcome to the Advanced Data Skills, Open Science and Reproducibility M.Res. unit PCHN63101. This unit will be taught via a flipped classroom model. Make sure you go through the content on this site in advance of the in-person sessions. These are held on Mondays from 1 to 3pm in the Coupland 3 Building in room room LG.118.

For questions about the course you can contact me via email (george.farmer@manchester.ac.uk). If you have any questions or technical problems relating to each week's content, please post these on the Canvas discussion board.

There are two assignments associated with this unit. The full details of these (plus hand in dates) can be found on the Canvas page for this unit.
