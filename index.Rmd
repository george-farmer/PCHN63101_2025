Welcome to the Advanced Data Skills, Open Science and Reproducibility M.Res. unit PCHN63101. This unit will be taught via a flipped classroom model. Make sure you go through the content on this site in advance of the in-person sessions. These are held on Mondays from 1 to 3pm in the Engineering A building (also known as the Nancy Rothwell building) in room room 3A.012.

For questions about the course you can contact me via email (george.farmer@manchester.ac.uk). If you have any questions or technical problems relating to each week's content, please post these on the Blackboard discussion board.

There are two assignments associated with this unit. The full details of these (plus hand in dates) can be found on the Blackboard page for this unit.
